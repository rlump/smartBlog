    - Node JS

    - <p></p><p></p><p>The most intriguing thing about node is that it is exactly
      in javascript the same model I have been using in C++ for many of years to program
      exchange connectivity middleware that powered a realtime trading systems for
      the options trading industry. I look forward to working with it !!</p>

    - <p> Node.js is a platform built JavaScript runtime for easily building fast,
      scalable web based applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking
      I/O model. It provides concurrency through a callback mechanism that is managed
      as a single threaded process and so it avoids all the messiness and inefficiencies
      of a multiple threaded program.</p>

    - Visiting All of the Louvre, Paris
    - /assets/louvre.jpg
    - museum
    - "<p></p>\r\n<p> I recommend getting the Paris museum pass. It's available for
      2, 4, or 6 days and gives unlimited access while valid to over 60 sites in Paris.
      Including of course the <a href=\"http://www.louvre.fr/en\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">
      Louvre. </a></p>\r\n<p>As for when to go to Paris. I like February. The weather
      is not all that cold (low 30F - high 45 F), the crowds are gone, and air fare
      and accomodations are cheaper.</p>"

      but I did it !! </p>
